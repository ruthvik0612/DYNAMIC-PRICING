# DYNAMIC-PRICING

# Dynamic Pricing Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end Machine Learning approach for Dynamic Pricing**, where product prices are optimized based on historical sales data and influencing features.  
The goal is to move from **static pricing** to **data-driven pricing decisions** using ML models.

This project covers the **complete ML lifecycle**: problem understanding, data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, evaluation, and insights.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Traditional pricing strategies fail to adapt to changes in demand and market conditions.  
The objective of this project is to **analyze historical pricing and sales data** and build a machine learning model that helps **predict optimal pricing patterns** to support better business decisions.
